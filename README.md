# Application 
  - Run the `start.sh` script to run the application. Note that you should have docker installed in your machine.

  - Once running, you may access the application swagger ui in **http://localhost:8083/dice-api/swagger-ui.html** 

# MongoDB
  - Access the mongodb using a client with the exposed port 27107.

  

     You can change the configurations (e.g. port number, mongodb admin user, db, etc) by changing the values in the env.local file inside the docker-files folder. 
     You may also change the docker-compose.yaml for your preferred configurations.
